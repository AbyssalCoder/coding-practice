## File Handling in Python

```python
# Writing
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, file!\n')
    f.write('Second line\n')

# Reading
with open('output.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)

# Reading line by line
with open('output.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
```

Always use `with` statements — they handle closing automatically.
