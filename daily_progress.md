## File Handling in Python

```python
# Writing
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('Hello, file!\n')
    f.write('Second line\n')

# Reading
with open('output.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)

# Reading line by line
with open('output.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
```

Always use `with` statements — they handle closing automatically.

## Bubble Sort

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break
    return arr

print(bubble_sort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]))
```

Worst case O(n²), best case O(n) with early exit.
